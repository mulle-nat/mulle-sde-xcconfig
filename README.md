## Xcode configurations

These configurations contain a lot of often used settings and principally make
Xcode aware of the `dependency` folder, that gets created by
[mulle-sde](//github.com/mulle-sde).


### How to embed with mulle-sde

```console
mulle-sde dependency add --embedded https://github.com/mulle-nat/mulle-sde-xcconfig.git
```
